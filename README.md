# Technicals-CNN
 Visually Predicting Stock Returns based on technicals using a CNN

This Repository Contains the following three Notebooks:
1. TechniclaIndicatorsImplementation
Contains the algorithmic realization of the chosen technical indicators that are considered in the prediction algoorithm ()

List of considered technical indicators:
Relative Strength Index, Raw Volume, Boolinger Bands, Aroon, Price Volume Trend, Acceleration Bands, Stochastic, Chaikan Money Flow, Rate of Change, CCI, Keltner Channels, Exponential Moving Average, MACD, Money Flow Index, Ichimoku, William %R, Volume Min/Max

2. ImageTransformationPyplot:
Creation of the training and test dataset. This file transforms the daily returns as well as the resulting technicals into images as CNN input.

3. CNN_Implementation:
This file implements the Convolutional Neural Network, trains it using the created images and tests it against the test set of images.
